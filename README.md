# <img src="https://github.com/nick-tharwal/Managify11/blob/main/20220904_093833_0000.png" width="60"/> Django E-commerce Website
This is a Django-based e-commerce website project that I developed to gain a deep understanding of the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture in Django. The website allows users to buy and sell items, communicate with each other, manage their items through a dashboard, and make use of various Django features such as form handling, customizations, and authentication.
