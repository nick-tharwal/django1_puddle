#  Django E-commerce Website
This is a Django-based e-commerce website project that I developed to gain a deep understanding of the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture in Django. The website allows users to buy and sell items, communicate with each other, manage their items through a dashboard, and make use of various Django features such as form handling, customizations, and authentication.

#   PROJECT THEME -
E-Commerce


#  FEATURES -
* __Authentication__: Users can create accounts, login, and logout securely. Passwords are hashed and stored securely in the database.
* __Communication Between Users__: Users can send messages to each other through the website to discuss items, negotiate prices, and ask questions.
* __Dashboard for Items__: Users have access to a personalized dashboard where they can manage their listed items, view order history, and track their sales.
* __Form Handling and Customizations__: The website includes custom forms for item listings, order processing, and user registration with validation and error handling.
* __Search Functionality__: Users can search for items based on keywords, categories, or other criteria to easily find what they are looking for.
* __User Profiles__: Users have their own profile pages where they can view their listed items, sold items, and contact information.
